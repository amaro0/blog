trying multiple solutions from stackoverflow and wasting countless hours, I found nothing was working for this basic EB
env.
Once again, AWS documentation failed me!
I have decided to stick with solution from docs and debug actual reason why <code>test_cron.sh</code> was not detecting leader
instance.
The issue I found on <code>test_cron.sh</code> script was both <code>INSTANCE_ID</code> and <code>REGION</code> were not populated with
metadata.
It turned out that both requests to <code>http://169.254.169.254/...</code> were failing with 401 errors.
Quickly found out <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html>here</a> how to
add authorization to that requests, and it worked. Look into <strong>TLDR</strong> for minimal <code>test_cron.sh</code> with proper
authentication.</p><p>This bug would be left unseen for way longer without awesome <a href=https://healthchecks.io/>healthchecks.io</a> monitoring.</p><p>Happy coding!</p></content><p><a href=https://amaro0.xyz/blog/aws/>#AWS</a>
